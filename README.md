# 🎤 Voice-to-Text Conversion & Speech Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Voice-to-Text Conversion & Speech Analysis System** is a Python-based web application that converts speech to text and performs detailed text analysis. It allows users to record live audio or upload audio files in various formats, transcribes the speech into text, and provides comprehensive insights including sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and text summarization. Users can also export a professional PDF report of the analysis.  

This project combines **speech recognition**, **NLP**, and **data visualization** to create a powerful tool for analyzing spoken content.
